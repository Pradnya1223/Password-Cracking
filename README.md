Password Cracking - Brute Force Approach
This project implements a simple password cracking tool using a brute force approach. The program systematically tries all possible combinations of characters to guess a target password. This method, although computationally expensive, demonstrates the underlying mechanics of how password guessing works.

Project Features:
Brute Force Password Cracker: The code generates all possible combinations of characters (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits) and tries each one.
Customizable Password Length: The cracker can be configured to attempt passwords of any length, making it adaptable for different scenarios.
Easy to Use: The code is easy to modify and extend to handle more complex scenarios such as integrating a dictionary attack or targeting specific character sets.
Educational Purpose: This project is primarily designed for educational purposes, to show the vulnerabilities of using weak or short passwords.

Technologies Used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
itertools (for generating combinations)
string (for character sets)
